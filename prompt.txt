Creatre a python script that sets up a basic CI/CD pipeline for a machine learning project. Include automated testing for a ML model, model validation checks, and a simple automated deployment process. I want you to make a 3 layer DNN (using convolutions and a fully connected layer) use MNIST dataset (download if required), and train only for one epoch. When you test, mention that what tests you are checking for. I would like to check if model is under 100000 parameters, takes 28x28 input without any issues, has 10 outputs, and accuracy is more than 80&. Make all the necessary files (for training as well as githyub actions related). Finally I should be able to upload whole code to Github, and github a tion should run all of these things to confirm the build was successful. Tell me steps to run locally as well before I push to github. for deployment add suffix to model file to get some detail on when it was trained
